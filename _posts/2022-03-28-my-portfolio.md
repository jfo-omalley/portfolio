As an information professional, I aim to bring the practices and values of librarianship to bear on issues of access, equity, and sustainability in the information society. I view librarianship as an approach to stewardship for all collections, local and global, implicit and explicit, and by extension the communities that rely on collections to serve and represent them and their memories. 

On this page, you will find a portfolio of some of the projects I completed during my pursuit of my MS in Library and Information Science at the Pratt School of Information. My emphasis is on remediating issues of representation and access in digital collections and, in particular, supporting the work of librarians, archivists, and community members interested in changing their institutional or collection level practices. My research focuses on institutional practices and collaborations, such as mutual aid and environmental sustainability. I employ methods informed by but not unique to library science such as metadata management and analysis, conservation, archival methods, user research, programming, and visualization.
